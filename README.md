## Project Overview

This landing page is designed for fitness clubs, gyms, and sport centers to showcase programs, plans, and schedules while guiding users through a **structured and conversion-focused journey**.

Rather than acting as a static website, this project implements a **smart UX flow** that automatically guides users through the booking process, preserves their choices, and reduces friction.

## 🧱 Sections

- Home (Hero)
- Features
- Classes
- Schedule
- Reviews
- Plans
- Contact

---

## ✨ Key UX Features

### 🧭 Smooth Scroll Navigation

- Smooth scrolling between all sections
- Navigation and hero buttons guide users to key sections

---

### 🤖 Guided User Journey

A smart, structured flow designed to help users move forward with confidence:

**Home → Classes → Plans → Contact**

The interface actively guides users to the next logical step instead of leaving them to decide where to go next.

---

### 🧠 Smart Section Logic

- Selecting a class automatically scrolls to the **Plans** section
- Selecting a plan automatically scrolls to the **Contact** section
- The system guides users to the most relevant next step

---

### 🔗 Preserved User Context

- Selected class is saved and shared across sections
- Selected plan is saved and shared across sections
- Both selections are automatically pre-filled in the contact form

---

### 🎯 Decision-Support UX

- Reduces user friction and repeated actions
- Helps users avoid getting stuck or overwhelmed
- Makes the booking experience simple and intuitive
- Increases the likelihood of form completion

---

### 🏠 Hero Section CTAs

- **View Classes** → scrolls to **Classes**
- **Book a Session** → scrolls directly to **Contact**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out

This project is built around **user guidance and decision support**, not just visual design.  
It demonstrates how front-end logic, shared state, and smooth navigation can be combined to create a real-world booking-style experience that feels intelligent, fast, and user-friendly.
